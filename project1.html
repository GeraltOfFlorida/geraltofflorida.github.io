                    <h3>Project Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        FileMorph is a file converter created for converting legacy Microsoft Office files (doc, xls, ppt)
                        into their modern counterparts (docx, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The need for this tool originated from a security decision made within the organization that blocked
                        users from accessing legacy Office files due to the risk of auto-executing macros being present in
                        them. After this decision was made, users were forced to submit any legacy Office files they needed
                        to access to the IT security team, who would scan the file for macros then convert it and deliver it
                        back to the user. This lengthy, work-stopping process was what spawned the need for an easier way
                        for users to access legacy Office files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users access FileMorph by navigating to the web UI in their browser. Office files uploaded to
                        FileMorph are scanned for macros using a Python library, then are converted to modern formats and
                        delivered back to the user via browser download.
                    </p>
