                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>
                    This Unraid home server has been an ongoing, ever-expanding personal project. I built the server
                    around August 2024, and have been making gradual hardware upgrades and setting up new services
                    since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core, this server is a NAS. It has around 30TB of disk storage which, currently, is enough
                    for our entire household to back their files up to. This server has definitely made moving files
                    between devices on our home network an afterthought. It also uses multiple NVMe SSDs as caches to
                    allow for frequently accessed files to be accessed quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unraid also has comprehensive Docker support. This server was my first foray into the world of
                    Docker and containerization, and I haven't looked back since. I've set up containers ranging from
                    simple, self-hosted tools, to complex media automation stacks that trivialize complex and tedious
                    workflows.
                </p>
